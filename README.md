## Description
This app is an app deployed in [heroku](https://dry-oasis-66126.herokuapp.com/) that allows the user to take notes.  These notes are then saved online for the next time the user goes onliine.  In this case, it is deployed at a public location so anyone can add or remove notes so it's not very sercure for one user.  But, if the repository here is copied and used locally it can be used by one person.

## Installation
Once the project is downloaded, the repository directory needs to be entered. It is assumed the user already had Node.js installed.  Given that the dependencies are known by the application, one only then needs to type "npm install" before using the application.  

## Usage
After everything is installed, one needs only to set their browser to "http://localhost:3001/" to use the application.  If used at the deployed location, one needs merely to click the link above and start using it. An [image](./images/image.png) is included as an example of what it looks like.  This was taken at the deployed location, but the locally run file looks the same.
